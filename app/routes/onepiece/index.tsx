            24 years ago, the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, was executed. However,
            before his death he revealed to everyone that his treasure, the One
            Piece, was hidden at the end of the Grand Line. This inspired people
            to become pirates and sail toward the treasure, beginning the Great
            Age of Pirates. Twelve years later, a young boy from the East Blue
            named Monkey D. Luffy dreamed of finding the One Piece, but lost the
            ability to swim after eating a Devil Fruit giving him the ability to
            stretch his body like rubber. He was given a straw hat by the pirate
            Shanks, who would later go on to become an Emperor, one of the four
            most powerful pirates in the world, on the agreement that he would
            return the hat once he became a pirate and surpassed Shanks.

                Marshall D. Teach, most commonly referred to by his epithet
                "Blackbeard", is the admiral of the Blackbeard Pirates, and one
                of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World. He is also
                the only known person in history to wield the powers of two
                Devil Fruits, as well as being part of a special bloodline,
                which is only known to a small number of individuals, including
                his own crew, Marco, and the Five Elders.
