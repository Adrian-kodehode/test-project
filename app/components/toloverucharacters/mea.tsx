            <strong>Kurosaki Mea</strong> is a character from To-Love-Ru
            Darkness. She is sent to Earth to bring back the "old"{" "}

              Yami
            </a>
            . It is revealed that she is Yami's younger sister as she was
            created by the same organization and from the same project (Project
            Eve) as her. At first she is found alone staring out the window
            until she meets Nana and becomes friends with her. She now views
            others as friends. It appears that she has sexual, though not
            necessarily emotional, feelings towards Rito, although she tends to
            use them in a playful, teasing way around him.

            Before coming to Earth, she was known as{" "}

            Appearance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Mea has violet/blue colored eyes and red hair with a really long
            braid. The upper part of her hair resembles Yami and Tearju's
            hairstyle. She also has a violet colored hair clip with an indigo
            colored cross on it and hair coming below it that's similar (yet
            smaller) to her braid. She's also seen letting her hair untied,
            mostly when taking a bath and when in combat. Sometimes she wears
            black Gothic clothing (which she calls it her true form) that's
            similar to what Yami usually wears but it's a lot more revealing,
            instead of a skirt she wears shorts and her top has a hood on it,
            also with a star shaped gap symbol on the chest part. This symbol
            also appears on Yami's and Nemesis' clothing. She usually wears a
            pair of striped panties, but doesn't wear any undergarment under her
            battle outfit. Her 3-sizes are B75-W52-H77.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold border-b mb-4" id="personality">
            Personality
          </h2>
          <p>
            Mea has a laid-back, mischievous and childish personality, bordering
            on the psychotic side sometimes. She is rarely not smiling,
            particularly in combat, acts friendly to friend and foe alike, and
            often says "wonderful" if something unfortunately perverted happens.
            Mea has a sweet tooth and likes anything sweet, preferring to put so
            many sugar cubes in her tea that they pile out the top of the cup.
            She seems to enjoy messing with and teasing people, particularly in
            regards to Rito and all the girls that have feelings for him.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            For example she has made more than one reference to him having
            licked her body or her desire for him to do so, though she makes
            this out as a joke. However it has been discovered by Oshizu (during
            her possession of Mea) that this desire is in fact completely
            genuine. It was also discovered by Oshizu that within Mea's mind is
            a darkness so deep that it almost consumed her and revealing a dark
            and scary side to her that has left her highly mistrustful of Mea
            ever since.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Mea is very loyal to Nemesis and follows her teachings about being a
            weapon and gets mad at anyone if they disrespect Nemesis in any way.
            However, there are those like Rito and Tearju who try to convince
            her otherwise. This seems to work as she seems to begin to care and
            consider others as friends and show sympathy towards "weaker"
            beings.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Mea doesn't show any kind of embarrassment or shame, not even when
            her clothes got ripped off. She instead prefers to get caught in
            awkward and/or sexual experiences, showing a sadomasochistic side.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Oddly, Mea's personality is practically the opposite of her sister
            Yami. She always seems kind and sweet around others, but has a
            sadistic side which she rarely shows, while Yami appears cold and
            emotionless around others, but has a nicer side that is rarely
            shown. Mea is fond of anything ecchi while Yami detests it, as can
            be seen in her fetish for being licked. The one thing the two do
            share is the ability to get overwhelmed by their powers; Mea,
            whenever taking apart in something as miniscule as cutting food, can
            enter a state of euphoria that forces her to continue cutting all
            things around her with glee, much like how Yami's anger towards
            ecchi keeps her from rationalizing between life and death.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold border-b mb-4" id="history">
            History
          </h2>
          <p>
            Through what Mea remembers, she is practically what's left of the
            Eden organization that created both her and Yami after it was
            destroyed. Awakening from a destroyed life pod, the first thing she
            sees is destruction everywhere. After wandering around for a moment,
            she came across Nemesis, who took her in, trained her, and taught
            her that the existence of a transformation weapon is only for
            killing. She also told her about her older sister Yami, whom Mea
            wanted to find by asking other criminals in space, which she managed
            to. Before she came to Earth, she made a living on bounty hunting.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Mea enrolled into Sainan High in order to get acquainted with Yami,
            a month before Momo and Nana did so. She did not make friends with
            anyone (and possibly didn't even talk to anyone) until she met Nana.

              Transformation Ability: As a second generation transformation
              weapon, Mea has transformation abilities similar to Yami because
              of the nano-machines in her body, except she is able to create
              more advanced machine/energy-based equipments, which Yami is
              unable to create. Most of them are transformed from her hair. She
              has been shown to create non-weapon objects like a puppet from her
              hand.

              • <strong>Weapon Transformation</strong>: Similar to Yami, Mea can
              shapeshift any part of her body into weapons such as blades.
              However, she is capable of creating many differently shaped
              gun-like machines that shoot laser beams that easily destroy
              powerful barriers and a micro-black hole.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              • <strong>Hair Manipulation</strong>: Mea can control and move her
              hair/pony tail (like an actual tail) and uses it for most of her
              transformation abilities like many different shape guns, a clawed
              hand or a blade at the end of it. Mea is shown to create bigger
              machines and a multitude of huge guns and blades. Mea can also
              extend the reach of hair.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              • <strong>Psycho Dive</strong>: An ability unique to Mea, which
              she can use to connect herself to another person's mind. By
              physically touching that person's forehead, she can enter their
              subconscious to steal information, look through their memories or
              even enter their dreams and recreate them to whatever she wants.
              This ability can also be used on machines, like when Mea connected
              her ponytail through the screen of a laptop. By connecting her
              ponytail at the back of a person's neck, she can control the
              movements of that person, and through this, both Mea and said
              person can share each other's thoughts and feelings, even deep
              feelings that Mea herself was not aware of. Mea can also connect
              with more than one person at same time. Sometimes Mea would
              playfully use this ability on Rito to get in his head and do ecchi
              things. Nana is the only known person to break free from this
              ability.

                • <strong>Body Transformation</strong>: Mea can alter the shape
                and size of her body or parts of it, like making her breasts
                bigger. Mea can also alter her size to copy the form and
                appearance of anyone (eg: Tearju), similar to shapeshifting.
              </p>
              <p>
                • <strong>Partial Animal Transformation</strong>: Mea has also
                been shown to use partial animal forms like growing a pair of
                feathered wings on her back to enable flight. She can also
                transform her hair into animal ears such as cat ears (Darkness
                Chapter 36). But it is also shown she can grow a pair of
                feathered wings with metalic parts on it, Probably does type of
                wings can be reffered as her wings specially made for speed
                (Darkness Chapter 46)
              </p>
              <p>
                • <strong>Vocal Alteration/Imatation</strong>: In addition to
                her shapeshifting abilities, she can also change her voice to
                sound like anyone she turns into.
