            <strong>Nemesis</strong> (ネメシス, Nemeshisu), also known as{" "}
            <strong>Master Nemesis</strong>, is a character introduced in To
            LOVE-Ru Darkness. She is a transformation weapon similar to Golden
            Darkness (Yami) and Kurosaki Mea, but does not share their genetic
            origins. She is Mea's master, whom she gives orders to and uses to
            observe Yami's changes and recent life. At the beginning of To
            LOVE-Ru Darkness, her original plan was to make Yami return to the
            heartless assassin she was before arriving on Earth, and she
            convinced Mea that this was the only life they were meant to live as
            weapons. Due to her catalystic role in the overall plot, she is
            considered the central antagonist of To LOVE-Ru Darkness.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Because she wants Yami to join her and become an assassin again, and
            wants Rito for herself (as her servant) because of his ability to
            influence Yami and Mea, Nemesis is essentially also the direct
            opponent of Momo's plan to include Yami, various other girls and
            herself in a harem for Rito. As of chapter 61, after a long and
            arduous battle with Gid Lucione Deviluke that left her on the brink
            of death, she accepted Rito's offer to "possess" her and live in his
            body until she is able to fully recover, giving her the ability to
            control his speech and body movements for short periods of time.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Her real name is unknown, and the name "Nemesis" is based on Project
            Nemesis, a weapon project organized by the assassin organization
            that created both Yami and Mea. According to Tearju Lunatique, the
            project was a failure, but Nemesis survived the project.

          <p>
            Nemesis is a petite girl with long black hair, golden eyes with
            vertical silt pupils, and dark skin. Because of her appearance, Rito
            had mistaken her for a little girl. However, she can change her
            appearance into anything she desires, such as a crow or a cat, or
            change herself into a well-endowed adult woman (a benefit of having
            complete hormonal control over her body). She has taken to giving
            herself cat ears.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At first she wore a skimpy black dress, but she used her abilities
            to change it into a black yukata (claiming how effective it is in a
            fight) with a star-shaped gap symbol on it (similar to the one Yami
            and Mea have on the chest of their black gothic dresses), and she
            has a yellow sash wrapped around her waist. When she first changed
            to the black yukata, she had a cat mask, which, combined with the
            Taichi figure, covers the left side of her head as decoration. She
            is shown wearing nothing underneath her clothes and is always naked
            underneath them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" id="personality">
            Personality
          </h2>
          <p>
            Nemesis is sadistic, mischievous, domineering and mysterious. She
            believes that a transformation weapon's only purpose for living is
            killing. She is often seen hiding in the shadows observing Rito, his
            friends, and their daily lives through Mea, until she began to
            approach them herself. She also has an eery and erotic side to her
            and finds Rito's shyness arousing and would like to have him as her
            servant. She said that she doesn't have full control over her erotic
            personality and would act on it on impulse. Upon her first
            appearance, her erotic tendencies quickly earned an uneasy
            impression from Rito and a strong disdain from Momo. She can be
            quite patient, like instead of persuading Yami to return to her old
            heartless life, she decides to wait until she uses the "Darkness
            ability", believing that Yami will return to that path naturally and
            that the "Darkness" will inevitably occur regardless of Yami's
            relationships on Earth.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Like Mea, she has a sweet tooth; she enjoys eating anything that
            contains Dark Matter.
          </p>
          <br />{" "}
          <p>
            She is eerily optimistic and apathetic at all times, and whether
            things go her way or not, when she is not entertained, she does
            little to show any negative feelings for any reason. Even after Mea
            disobeys her and her plan to activate Yami's Darkness transformation
            failed, she does not appear to mind. And even after a fierce battle
            left her on the verge of imminent death, she expresses no regrets
            disappearing after all of the fun and mischief she had, as well as
            some relief towards the thought of her life coming to an end,
            indicating that beneath her childlike and bratty demeanor, she's a
            truly depressed and lonely being.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It is unknown if Nemesis has feelings for Rito, but she enjoys being
            fused with him, as she teases him when the opportunity presents
            itself and comments that her life is now more interesting now that
            she is fused with Rito.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" id="history">
            History
          </h2>
          <p>
            Nemesis was the result of "Project Nemesis", a different experiment
            from the project that created Golden Darkness, conducted by the
            organization known as Eden. The experiment was an attempt to create
            a living weapon composed of Dark Matter, which was abundant
            throughout the universe. However, the project was scrapped and
            abandoned because of the scientists' failure to materialized form.
            But unknown to them, Nemesis existed as a formless and unseen
            intelligence, wandering the facilities for years and overseeing the
            creations of Golden Darkness and Mea, both human-based
            Transformation weapons, until the organization's collapse at the
            hands of Black, and Mea's release.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Mea remembers that Nemesis came to the fallen organization where she
            found Mea and decided to raise her. At that time, both their
            physical condition were unstable and Nemesis was on the verge of
            disappearing, so she used her ability to fuse with Mea to stabilize
            herself. Nemesis always created images of herself to make Mea
            believe that they are both speaking to each other as separate
            people, and Mea was unaware that Nemesis existed inside her body.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Nemesis taught Mea that the purpose of a Transformation Weapon is to
            kill. She also taught her about her sister, Golden Darkness, whom
            they came to Earth to bring back into space as who she was before.

          <p>
            <strong>Dark Matter-based Physiology</strong>: Nemesis' body
            consists of dark matter that allows her the trans ability rather
            than having nanomachines. While she possesses the same common
            shape-shifting abilities as Yami and Mea, her powers are
            fundamentally different in nature and possesses some abilities
            unique to herself.

                • <strong>Shape-shifting</strong>: Nemesis can alter her
                appearance and reshape her body to look more adult-like and even
                change her appearance to look exactly like other people. She can
                fully transform into animals, even those much smaller than
                herself, such as a crow or a cat. She can also grow a pair of

                black nightgown and a yukata. She is also seen wearing a maid

                • <strong>Trans-Fusion</strong>: One of Nemesis' own unique
                abilities, which allows her to fuse her body with that of
                another person. She was forced to fuse herself with the body of
                Mea Kurosaki, where she continued to watch things happen around
                Mea from inside her body. Nemesis explained that she used this
                ability on Mea because at the time, Nemesis was in a physically
                unstable condition, and so she needed to exist inside Mea's body
                as a vessel until she can stabilize herself, and then she can
                leave Mea's body. While under Trans-fusion, she is able to
                communicate with Mea, and even create an image of herself in her
                mind, so as to give Mea the illusion of them speaking with each
                other face to face in the physical world. This ability is not
                limited to another Tranformation Weapon, as she is able to fuse
                with Rito, which gives her the ability to forcefully control his
                movements for a short amount of time, depending on her current
                strength. For manipulating other people's body, Nemesis uses a
                voodoo doll
