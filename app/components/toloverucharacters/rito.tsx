          <strong>Yūki Rito</strong> is the main male protagonist of the To
          Love-Ru series, and its sequel, To Love-Ru Darkness. He is a normal
          16-year-old student of Sainan High, who has a big crush on Sairenji
          Haruna, to whom he attempted numerous times to confess to but has met
          failure each time. It was only by accident that he met Lala Satalin
          Deviluke, an alien princess he accidentally became engaged to.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Rito used to be on the soccer team in junior high and was fairly good,
          but quit because he was constantly helping his father with his manga
          duties, and did not want to leave his little sister Yūki Mikan alone
          in the house. Mikan comments he is very good at the most "useless
          little things", like crane and festival games (e.g. hoops, catching
          fish, squirt guns). Along with the many useless little things Rito is
          good at, he is also an accomplished florist, gardener and
          horticulturist.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Rito's nature is an extremely loving one, yet also somewhat clumsy,
          where he always ends up unintentionally molesting or groping the many
          girls in the series. He is generally very kind, thoughtful and has a
          lot of respect for women, though mostly by intention, and not so much
          by a success. Due to his shyness around girls, he is very awkward
          around women and has great difficulty maintaining his composure around
          any sort of stimulating situation. Even without interference from
          Lala's inventions, Oshizu's psychic powers, or Celine jumping into his
          face, Rito is individually clumsy enough to trip over absolutely
          nothing, and possesses extraordinary skill in accidentally reaching
          his hands or face into the breasts or other private parts of any girl
          within reach when he is falling. He is constantly viewed as a
          "pervert" but unknowingly, his kindliness is what wins him the
          affections of most of the girls in the series.
        </p>
        <br />{" "}
        <p>
          Over time he also comes to love Lala and knowing his feelings for
          Haruna, she suggests for him to be with both of them, because due to
          being engaged to her, he is next in line for the throne of Deviluke,
          which would make polygamy legal for him. In{" "}
          <strong>To Love-Ru Darkness</strong>, Lala's little sister Momo also
          falls in love with Rito and expands Lala's initial idea into her harem
          plan, where she and all the other girls who love Rito can be with him.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As of Chapter 61 of Darkness, Rito became Nemesis' Trans-Fusion host
          after he offered her his body as a temporary home until she recovered
          enough power to retain a physical form. Nemesis inside Rito knew that
          he has feelings for Haruna, so she created an atmosphere so under such
          circumstances they finally confessed to each other (Chapter 75 & 76).
