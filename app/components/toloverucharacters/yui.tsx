            <strong>Yui Kotegawa</strong> is a secondary female protagonist, who
            belongs in Rito's class throughout the second year. She is also the
            head of the school disciplinary committee.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yui appears a high-strung girl who behaves in strong tsundere
            personality, and is very strict against inappropriate manners. Like
            most of the other girls in the series, she also becomes a love
            interest of Rito, despite she is more reluctant to admit it other
            than most of these girls, due to her tsundere personality.

              the pair are often idolized by other girls for their beautiful
              figures. This has lead characters such as Sairenji Haruna, who
              would otherwise be considered perfectly normal for her age to feel
              inferior. Ironically, they both are mostly oblivious to this.

              To Yui, however, her generous figure has become a source of
              embarrassment for her. A fact that is exploited by Momioka Risa
              and others to tease her. Yui herself has confirmed that she
              started wearing bras in middle school showing that she was an
              early bloomer.

                "Shameless!" <br />
                ―Yui's trademark word
              </h3>
              <p className="mt-8">
                Yui Kotegawa is a high-strung and uptight girl, she has little
                to no tolerance for anything perverted, students who bring
                personal items to school, misbehaving, or whatever she does not
                consider to be "acceptable behavior". Her opinions, quick
                temper, and habit of speaking her mind often results in her
                vocally reprimanding classmates. Yui quickly grows annoyed and
                disgusted by eccentricities and bizarre actions, especially with
                regards to Yūki Rito and Lala Satalin Deviluke.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Unfortunately, almost every encounter with Rito usually ends up
                with her embarrassed, naked or fondled (sometimes all three
                combined), and although her nature prevents her from easing her
                behavior, she is slowly warming up to his usual antics. After
                Rito saves Yui from a group of delinquents, she develops
                feelings for him. Her inexperience with boys leaves her unable
                to understand her own feelings and continually denies them to
                herself.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                When Rito usually asks what is wrong, she says the exact
                opposite of what she wants to say and then yells at him in some
                way (a typical Tsundere), she tends to blush every time someone
                mentions him and also thinks about him through something
                irrelevant like when Momioka Risa asked if she had anyone she
                likes or him complimenting on her yukata or even when seeing
                Yūsaki Riko. For some time now she has come to realize that she
                is in love with Rito, a fact she is annoyed about given her
                opinion of him. Deep down (despite being strongly against lewd
                things) she actually desires to do these things with him. On one
                occasion, during one of Rito's accidents, she offered herself to
                him, on the condition that he would only ever do it with her
                (To-Love-Ru Darkness Chapter 4). This may also be a hint which
                shows her hypocrisy towards things she considered "shameless",
                or this is just a typical trait of those who are tsundere. She
                has been seen fantasizing about being together with him and
                Celine, as his wife and being pregnant with his child.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Eventually, Yui gained the ability to recognize Rito's trademark
                clumsiness that she witnesses whenever he trips, even when he is
                disguised as someone else.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Despite her seemingly cold and stern facade, Yui is in fact a
                generally kind and sweet person at heart.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                She also really likes cats – owning cat based books, having tons
                of stuff cat dolls which she decorates her room with along with
                other cat-shaped things, shaping her Valentine chocolate into a
                cat's face, and even having a cat-themed floaty, something Rito
                seems to find cute about her. She would secretly go to pet
                stores to look at cats. she would get embarrassed if anyone were
                to find out about this.
