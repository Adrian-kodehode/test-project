            <p>
              Lala is the main female protagonist in the To Love-Ru series. Lala
              is a princess from the planet Deviluke who ran away from home to
              avoid meeting marriage suitors set by her father and to explore
              the outside world. While on the run, she randomly teleports to
              Rito's bathtub while he is taking a bath. She introduces herself
              to him, and he relunctantly defends her from her pursuers. The
              Next day, Rito meets with Haruna, the girl he loves. He shuts his
              eyes, bows his head, and finally confesses his love to her, only
              to open his eyes and finds Lala in front of him and receiving his
              confession, much to her joy. Lala goes along with it so she can
              stay on Earth, until Zastin arrives to bring her home. Lala
              hastily decides she wants to marry Rito to stay on Earth, much to
              his dismay, and Zastin proceeds to attack him. But after hearing
              Rito's speech about marriage only working if the two have feelings
              for each other, they both misinterpret his exact intention,
              believing that he truly understands Lala's feelings, and Lala
              truly falls in love with him and decides to marry him for real,
              which Zastin also ignorantly approves of.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Throughout the series, Lala helps Rito against her former fiancé
              candidates and encounters many characters whom she befriends,
              including Haruna (the girl that Rito truly loves), whom she sees
              as her best friend, and several other characters, including human
              classmates, other human-like aliens, and Lala's younger sisters,
              twins Nana and Momo. Despite Lala's antics, childish personality,
              and how often she likes to cling onto him, Rito's friendship with
              Lala develops, and their relationship becomes more stable and
              comfortable. As Lala and Haruna become closer friends, Haruna
              confesses that she is also in love with Rito, which Lala is
              strangely happy about. As stated by Saruyama, Rito progressively
              changes a lot around girls since Lala came into his life. Hearing
              this, Rito realizes that he has also fallen in love with Lala as
              well. Later he manages to tell Lala his feelings towards her and
              Haruna, which she is happy either way, explaining to him that when
              they marry, he would become king of Deviluke, and then Earth laws
              will not apply to him, making polygamy legal for him, which means
              he can marry both her and Haruna. So she encourages Rito to
              confess to Haruna (knowing she has feelings for him but didn't
              tell him) so they can all be together. Unfortunately, Rito
              idiotically confesses once again blindly, and opens his eyes to
              find four other girls in front of him receiving his love
              confession, none of whom was Haruna.

              In To Love-Ru Darkness, Lala becomes a supporting character and
              continues to support Rito and Haruna's relationship and keep the
              running gag of her inventions going. Her younger sister, Momo, who
              has also fallen in love with Rito, hopes that Rito's marriage to
              Lala would open up the chance for other girls, including herself,
              to also marry him. In Darkness Chapter 34-35, Peke and Momo advise
              her to strengthen her relationship with Rito, and she does so by
              clinging on to him like before, then wanting to try a kiss. Before
              she actualy does kiss him, Nana tells her that Rito has some
              complicated things he needs to solve first before the kiss, which
              would only make things even more complicated. Lala, understanding
              how he feels, decides to wait until he returns her feelings and
              kisses him on the cheek instead.

              When Yami activates her Darkness transformation, she gains much
              more power and a different personality. Lala attempts to save and
              protect Rito from her, and Yami battles against Lala. It climaxes
              with Yami creating a huge blade to kill Lala with and take Rito
              with her. Ignoring the advice from Rito to run, Lala instead holds
              him closer asking him to stay with her, since if he's with her,
              then she'll be able to put out max power. She manages to deflect
              Yami's attack with her tail laser, but as a result of overusing
              her power, she is physically reduced to a child-like form.
